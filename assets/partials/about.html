<h2>VolgaCTF 2025 Final regulations</h2>

</ul>

<p class="lead">We are going to invite top teams (according to VolgaCTF 2025 Qualifier scoreboard) on the condition that these teams <i>have specified a higher education institution in their profile</i>. If there appears to be several teams coming from the same educational establishment in the list, we will invite <strong>the one having the highest rank</strong> among those teams.</p>

<p class="lead">The board may change these quotas on technical grounds. Also, we may invite several guest teams by means of additional quota.</p>

<p class="lead">Invitations will be sent to emails specified in teamsâ€™ profiles. It is <strong>imperative</strong> that the team eligible for participation in VolgaCTF 2025 Final confirms its participation <strong>by Aug 1</strong>.</p>

<ul class="lead">
  <li>if a team denies taking part in the competition, or does not provide timely confirmation of participation,</li>
  <li>if a team is unable to cover its travel and accommodation costs (we <strong>do not</strong> provide financial support).</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Should any team be excluded from the preliminary list, the next one of the same quota (according to VolgaCTF 2025 Qualifier scoreboard) will be invited.</p>
